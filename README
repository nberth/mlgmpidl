# This file is part of the MLGmpIDL OCaml interface for GMP (and MPFR),
# released under LGPL license.

# Please read the COPYING file packaged in the distribution

This package is an OCAML interface for GMP and MPFR libraries.

The interface is decomposed into 5 modules:
Mpz       : GMP multiprecision integers
Mpzf      : GMP multiprecision integers, functional version
	    (no side-effect on numbers)
Mpq       : GMP multiprecision rationals
Mpqf      : GMP multiprecision rationals, functional version
	    (no side-effect on numbers)
Mpf       : GMP multiprecision floating-point numbers
Gmp_random: GMP random numbers generation
Mpfr      : MPFR multiprecision floating-point numbers
Mpfr      : MPFR multiprecision floating-point numbers
Mpfrf	  : MPFR multiprecision floating-point numbers, functional version
	    (no side-effect on numbers)

Compared to the well-known MLGMP interface developped by D. Monniaux
(http://www.di.ens.fr/~monniaux/programmes.html.en), MLGMPIDL favours an
imperative interface to a functional interface (all functions are offered in an
imperative version, more efficient in term of memory allocation). Moreover, it
uses CamlIDL, which allows to design easily further OCaml/C interface that
needs GMP types, using "import mpz.idl" clauses. The APRON project exploits
this.

REQUIREMENTS
============
GMP library (tested with version 4.0 and up)
MPFR library (optional, tested with version 2.2.x)
OCaml 3.0 or up (tested with 3.09)
Camlidl (tested with 1.05)
GNU sed, version 4.1 or up

INSTALLATION
============

1. Library
----------

Set the file Makefile.config using the Makefile.config model to your own
setting.  You might also have to modify the Makefile for executables

If you download from the subversion repository, type 'make
rebuild', which builds .ml, .mli, and _caml.c files from .idl
files.

type 'make', and then 'make install'

The OCaml part of the library is named gmp.cma (.cmxa, .a).
The C part of the library is named libgmp_caml.a
(libgmp_caml_debug.a)

'make install' installs not only .mli, .cmi, but also .idl files.

Be aware however that importing those .idl files from other .idl
files will probably request the application of SED editor with the
scripts sedscript_caml and sedscript_c (look at the Makefile).

2. Interpreter and toplevel
---------------------------

You may also generate runtime and toplevel with
'make gmprun', 'make gmptop'

3. Documentation
----------------

The documentation (currently very sketchy) is generated with ocamldoc.

'make mlgmpidl.dvi'
'make html' (put the HTML files in the html subdirectoy)

4. Miscellaneous
----------------

'make clean' and 'make distclean' have the usual behaviour. 
'make mostlyclean', in addition to 'make clean', removes the .ml,
.mli and _caml.c files generated from .idl files.
